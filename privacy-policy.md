# Privacy Policy for My Device ID Extension

**Effective Date:** 27-04-2025

## 1. Introduction

My Device ID ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user data.

## 2. Data Collection

The Extension does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal, sensitive, or identifiable user information.  
It only generates and stores a random device identifier (Device ID) and an optional device name locally on the user's browser using Chrome's `storage` API.

## 3. Data Usage

The generated Device ID and optional Device Name are:
- Stored locally on the user's device.
- Used only for the purpose of allowing the userâ€™s web application to uniquely identify the device.
- Not transmitted to any external servers by the Extension itself.

## 4. Permissions

The Extension uses the following Chrome permissions:
- `storage`: to save the generated Device ID and Device Name.
- `<all_urls>`: to enable the extension to respond to device ID requests from authorized web pages. No browsing activity or page content is accessed or stored.

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer user data to third parties under any circumstances.

## 6. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted publicly on the repository.

## 7. Contact
